Information Optics and Photonics Laboratory (IOP Lab) is a leading group in studying on three-dimensional (3-D) imaging, processing, and display technologies, ranging from biological cells to human body, using optics and digital holography.

IOP Lab currently focuses on the following research topics: 

1. Digital holographic imaging in microscopy and tomography, including nano/micro-optics element measurement and inspection, biomedical cell imaging etc.
2. 3-D image and digital hologram process based on artificial intelligence (AI) with machine/deep learning.
3. 3-D imaging and display methods, including 3-D information acquisition, camera, display and related techniques and applications. 

We hope to realize 3-D holographic dreams in the digital world for the coming new era.
